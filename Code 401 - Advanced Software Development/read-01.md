> In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.

Beginners learning Python face challenges akin to the "pain of growth," such as grappling with new concepts and navigating emotional uncertainties. To overcome these hurdles, they can adopt a growth-oriented mindset, seeing learning as essential for personal growth, and actively seek support through research and community-building, aligning with the advice to embrace the learning process and seek help when facing challenges.


> After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.

Big O notation helps measure how well an algorithm performs based on data size. It's a way to describe an algorithm's speed or space usage. This guide covers common notations like O(1), O(N), O(N²), and O(2^N), giving examples with simple code. It also explains logarithms (O(log N)) using the binary search technique. Understanding Big O helps make informed choices when dealing with algorithms and big data sets.

> Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

Mutable objects are those whose values can be altered after creation, such as lists, dictionaries, and sets. On the other hand, immutable objects, like integers, floats, and tuples, cannot be changed once they are created.
