# Read: Class 04

> Why is this important?

- A solid grasp of Python classes, objects, recursion, Pytest fixtures, and code coverage is pivotal for structuring code in an object-oriented fashion. Mastering these concepts supports effective troubleshooting, debugging, and collaboration within development teams, contributing to the success and scalability of software projects.

# Readings: Topic

1. What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

- In Python, classes function as a design blueprint for creating objects, offering a template that encapsulates both data structure and associated methods. They play a pivotal role in bundling together data and functionality, providing a cohesive unit within the code.

Objects are like instances of a class in Python. They represent real-world things and are created based on a class description. Each object comes with its own set of characteristics (attributes) and functions (methods).

2. Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?

- Recursion involves solving problems through the process of breaking them into progressively smaller sub-problems until they reach a point where they can be directly solved. To make the most of recursion:

Establish a base case to halt the recursive process.
Guarantee continuous progress toward reaching the base case.
Steer clear of falling into infinite recursion loops.

3. What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

- Fixtures serve the purpose of establishing a shared testing environment, while code coverage assesses the proportion of code addressed by tests. Fixtures act as a means to establish a consistent starting point for tests, defining preconditions, and are identified by the @pytest.fixture decorator in the fixture function.
