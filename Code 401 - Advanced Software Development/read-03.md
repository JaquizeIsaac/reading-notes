> Why is this important?

Python's file I/O and exception handling is crucial for robust software. It empowers developers to efficiently handle data, manage resources effectively, and gracefully respond to unexpected situations, enhancing software usability and reliability.

Readings: FileIO & Exceptions

> What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?

It assists in handling resources when reading and writing files, guaranteeing the file closure once the program completes its operations. Even in the event of an exception, it ensures proper file closure, maintaining resource integrity.

> Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method.

The read() method retrieves the complete file content and presents it as a unified string. Meanwhile, the readline() method extracts and provides a single line from the file as a string.

> Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.

Exception handling in Python deals with errors that occur while running code. The try block contains the potentially problematic code. If errors arise, the except block manages them smoothly. The finally block runs regardless, allowing for essential clean-up or closure tasks.
