> When should you use an unordered list in your HTML document?

* You should use an unordered list in your HTML document when you want to display a list of items, features, or information without any particular order. Unordered lists are often represented with bullet points. Common uses include creating navigation menus, showcasing features, FAQs, and simple bulleted lists. 

> How do you change the bullet style of unordered list items?

* To change the style of the bullets in an unordered list, you can use CSS. Here are some common styles:

Default Bullets: list-style-type: disc;
Circle Bullets: list-style-type: circle;
Square Bullets: list-style-type: square;
Numbers: list-style-type: decimal;
Roman Numerals (Uppercase): list-style-type: upper-roman;
Roman Numerals (Lowercase): list-style-type: lower-roman;


> When should you use an ordered list vs an unorder list in your HTML document?

* You should use an ordered list when you want to present a list of items in a specific order, like steps in a process or a ranking. Use an unordered list when the order of items doesn't matter, such as for a simple list of items or features. In ordered lists, items are numbered (1, 2, 3), while unordered lists use bullet points.

> Describe two ways you can change the numbers on list items provided by an ordered list?

* Change Number Style: You can use CSS to change how the numbers appear. For instance, you can use Roman numerals (I, II, III) or letters (A, B, C) instead of regular numbers (1, 2, 3).

* Start from a Different Number: You can specify where the list begins. So, instead of starting from 1, you can begin with any number you want, like 5 or 10.
