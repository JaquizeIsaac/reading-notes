# Debugging

## What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

> Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

* Syntax Error:

Syntax errors are like grammar mistakes in your code.
They occur when you write code that doesn't follow the rules of the programming language.
These errors are caught by the computer before the code runs, and it won't work until you fix them.
Logic Error:

Logic errors are like saying something that doesn't make sense, even if your grammar is correct.
They happen when your code doesn't do what you intended it to do.
Your code runs without errors, but it doesn't give the right result.
You need to figure out what's wrong by checking your logic and how the code is written.
In simpler terms, syntax errors are like spelling and grammar mistakes that stop your code from running, while logic errors are like saying something that's technically correct but doesn't make sense in the context of your code.


> List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

* Syntax Errors:

Issue: Like spelling mistakes in code.
Correction: Look for squiggly red lines or error messages in your code editor, and fix what they point to.
Logic Errors:

Issue: Your code doesn't do what you want.
Correction: Use print statements or debugging tools to find where your code goes wrong and adjust it.
Runtime Errors:

Issue: Errors that show up when your program is running.
Correction: Read the error messages, understand the issue, and change your code accordingly.
Variable Scope Errors:

Issue: Using variables where they're not allowed.
Correction: Check where you declared your variables and make sure they're in the right place.
Infinite Loops:

Issue: Your program keeps running forever.
Correction: Check your loops' conditions and add a way to exit the loop.
Data Type Errors:

Issue: Using the wrong type of data in the wrong place.
Correction: Make sure you're using the right type of data where it's needed. If needed, change the data type.

> How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

* Skill Improvement: You become a better coder, which can help you in your job and open up new opportunities.

Problem Solving: It improves your ability to solve all kinds of problems, not just in coding.

Career Growth: You might get promoted or lead bigger projects.

Versatility: You can work on more types of projects.

Helping Others: You can teach and guide others.

Good Reputation: You build a good name in the coding community, which can lead to new jobs or collaborations.

Entrepreneurship: It's useful if you want to start your own tech business.

Learning: You get used to learning new things, which is important in a fast-changing field like web development.


## The JavaScript Debugger

> How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

* Think of it as a tool to find and fix problems in your code.
You can tell it where to look for issues (breakpoints).
It helps you see what's inside your code (variables).
You can go through your code step by step.
It points to the exact line where something's wrong.
You can make changes to fix the problems and check if they work.
It's like being a detective, using this tool to solve the mystery of what's wrong with your code and make it right.


> Define what a breakpoint is.

* breakpoint is a designated point in your code where you tell the debugger to pause the program's execution. When the code reaches a breakpoint, it stops, allowing you to inspect the program's state, variables, and step through the code to understand its behavior. Breakpoints are valuable for identifying issues and debugging your code effectively. You can set breakpoints at specific lines of code or within functions to examine what's happening at those points in your program.

> What is the call stack?

* he call stack is a data structure in computer programming that keeps track of the function calls that are currently being executed by a program. It operates on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, which means that the most recently called function is the first one to be completed.
