## CSS Layout 

> What is meant by “normal flow”?

* Its describe how elements on a web page are positioned and flow by default, without any specific CSS positioning or floating applied.

> What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

* Block-Level Elements:

They start on a new line and take up the full width.
Examples: paragraphs, headings, lists.
They can hold other elements, both block-level and inline.
They make elements stack vertically.

* Inline Elements:

They don't start on a new line and only take up the space they need.
Examples: links, bold/italic text.
They can only hold other inline elements or text.
They flow within the text, going from left to right.

> ___ positioning is the default for every html element.

* Block-level

> Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

Precise Placement: You can put an element exactly where you want it on the page.

Layer Control: You can decide which elements appear in front of or behind others.

Layout Freedom: Elements with absolute positioning won't affect how other elements are laid out.

Complex Designs: Useful for creating intricate layouts and custom designs.

Interactive Features: Often used for animations and interactive elements in web design.

> What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

* Fixed Positioning:

Fixed positioning is relative to the viewport. An element with fixed positioning stays in the same position on the screen, even if you scroll the page.
It doesn't move when you scroll up or down; it remains in the same place on the screen.

* Absolute Positioning:

Absolute positioning is relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. If there is no positioned ancestor, it's relative to the initial containing block, which is usually the viewport.
It moves with its closest positioned ancestor, and if there isn't one, it moves with the page content as you scroll.
