### Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

* HTML Parsing: HTML defines the webpage's structure. The browser parses it into a structured tree called the DOM.

CSS Parsing: CSS styles the HTML elements. The browser reads and applies these styles to the DOM, creating the CSSOM.

JavaScript Parsing: JavaScript adds interactivity. It's either parsed and executed while parsing HTML (synchronously) or after the HTML is parsed (asynchronously or deferred). It can modify the DOM and CSSOM.
