> During my service in the United States Army, I served as a 92F, a fueler. I asked chatGPT "What is a 92F in the Army". It was extremely accurate to what I understand and know a 92F to be.

* The repsonse " As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, the United States Army Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) code 92F corresponds to "Petroleum Supply Specialist." A Petroleum Supply Specialist (often referred to as a "Fueler" or "Fuel Specialist") is responsible for receiving, storing, and distributing various types of petroleum and other bulk fuels. Their duties include operating and maintaining equipment used in the storage and transportation of fuel, as well as ensuring that fueling operations are conducted safely and efficiently."
