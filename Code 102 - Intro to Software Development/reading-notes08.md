# What is an expression in JavaScript?

- In JavaScript, an expression is code that results in a value, such as a variable, constant, operation, or function call.

> Why would we use a loop in our code?

- Loops are employed in code to carry out a set of instructions repeatedly, serving various purposes:

Repetition: When a task needs to be done multiple times, such as handling elements in an array.

Automation: For automating recurring tasks, like generating reports or managing extensive data.

Iteration: To cycle through a collection of items, like going through characters in a string.

Conditional Execution: To run code as long as a specific condition is met, or until it's no longer satisfied, like continuously checking for user input.

Efficiency: To create concise and efficient code, instead of repeating the same instructions over and over.

JavaScript provides loops like for, while, and do...while to control how many times a block of code is executed, making your code more adaptable and versatile.

> When does a for loop stop executing?

- A for loop in JavaScript stops running when the condition specified at the beginning of the loop evaluates to false. This condition is checked before each iteration of the loop. Once the condition is no longer true, the loop terminates, and the program proceeds with the code after the loop.

> How many times will a while loop execute?

- A while loop in JavaScript will keep running as long as the condition stated at the beginning of the loop remains true. The loop will continue to execute until the condition becomes false. The number of times the loop runs depends on when the condition switches from true to false.
